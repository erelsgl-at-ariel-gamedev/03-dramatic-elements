# Unity week 3: Dramatic Elements

A project with step-by-step scenes illustrating some dramatic elements of game development in Unity,
including animation, audio, user-interface, scene loading, and video.

Text explanations are available 
[here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/gamedev-5780) in folder 07.

NOTE: When you first open this project, you may not see the text in the score field.
This is because TextMesh Pro is not in the project.
The Unity Editor should hopefully prompt you to import TextMeshPro;
once you do this, re-open the scenes, and you should be able to see the texts.
